Live Coding Session
===================

1. Runing php in a document.
Let's run our Hello world example:

 <?php 
     echo "Hello world!";                                         
  ?>
  
  Excellent. Let's copy paste the following and check how php parses html and php

<p>This is going to be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.</p>
<?php echo 'While this is going to be parsed.'; ?>
<p>This will also be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.</p>

2. Variables and data

 <?php 
     $name = "Pippo";
     echo "Hello world!, $name";                                         
     echo "Hello world," . $name;
  ?>
  
 <?php 
     $name = "Pippo";
     $age = 18;
     
     echo "My name is $name, I'm $age years old.";                                         
  ?>  

3. Forms
Let's open form.php and play with various ways of sending data to a php file from a form.


4. Math operations
Check out some math operations in math.php

5. Conditionals and logical operations
Open conditional.php and observe how to set conditions

First Interlude: Open i1-magic.php and implement our usual magic number game, this time in php

6. Loops and Arrays
We can iterate on a block of code with "for", "foreach", while... Check out arrays-loops.php

7. Functions
Let's check how we can define functions in php. Open functions.php

8. Including files
Include files allow us to reuse pieces of functionality or html code. Replace the functions definition by functions.inc

require "functions.inc";
